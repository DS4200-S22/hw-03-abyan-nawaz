            <p class="graph-exp">The data type shown are attributes in which categorical data is shown for each category that is being compared. The data type is also quantitative as the amount of each smaller category, which is differentiated by different colors within each bar, within each category (bar) is measured in amount by the y-axis. The marks within this image are lines that make up the bars. The channels used are the horizontal and vertical positioning of the bars, the different colors used within each bar, and the area of the lines being expanded into the shapes of a bars. The marks used are links, specifically containment marks as the areas of the bars are used to compare different subcategories between major categories as well as between major categories. In other words, the larger categories per bar are compared with one another, and the subcategories are being compared with one another within the categories (which is represented by different colors in each bar.</p>

            <p class="graph-exp">Items exist within this visualization as nodes of a network. These nodes are then connected by links which are used to show relationships between the different nodes within a mind map, such as “Ideas,” “Categories,” and “Themes.” Points are used for different “Ideas,” “Category,” and “Theme” and lines are used to connect between each of point to represent a relationship. Different colors are used for “Ideas,” “Category,” and “Theme,” the areas of each point are different, and the positioning of the points are placed so that the “Ideas” branch out from either the “Theme” or “Category.”</p>

            <p class="graph-exp">Items are used within this visualization as nodes. Also, there are lines between each node to signify a relationship between the two nodes. In this case, the relationship would be the change in rank over time for a node. Points and lines are used as marks within this visualization. The points are different colors to signify different nodes. These points are horizontally and vertically positioned throughout the visualization to show the change in rankings. Lines with the same colors of the node are connected to each point over each change in year to show the connection between the attribute in the time prior and in the future compared to the selected point.</p>

            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/VHcf5xS/bubble-and-pie-chart.png" alt="bubble-and-pie-chart" border="0">
            <p class="graph-exp">The data type shown is attributes: both quantitative and categorical data is present within this visualization. The marks are represented as points and areas. Each point in the visualization is shown as an area, or pi chart. The color within each point is used to compare the differences within categories, and the different sizes and positions of the points are used to compare different quantitative performances between each point. Marks are used as both nodes and links, as the position of the points represent the quantitative amount of each node. On the other hand, the area of the points represent link as containment because they show hierarchical relationships between within attributes using area</p>
